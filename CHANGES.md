# Python Liquid Change Log

## Version 1.11.0 (unreleased)

**Fixes**

- Added an additional implementation of the `split` filter, which resolves some compatibility issues between Python Liquid's and the reference implementation. Previously, when given an empty string to split or when the string and the delimiter were equal, we used Python's `str.split()` behavior of producing one or two element lists containing empty strings. We now match Shopify/Liquid in returning an empty list for such cases. The new `split` filter will be enabled by default when using [`liquid.future.Environment`](https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/api/future-environment), and can optionally be registered with `liquid.Environment` for those that don't mind the behavioral change. See [#135](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/pull/135).

## Version 1.10.1

**Fixes**

- Fixed unexpected errors from the `date` filter when it's given an invalid format string. Previously we were raising a `liquid.exceptions.Error` in response to a `ValueError` from [strftime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.strftime). We now raise a `FilterArgumentError` with its `__cause__` set to the `ValueError`.
- Fixed handling of `"%s"` date filter format strings. We now fall back to a string representation of `datetime.timestamp()` for platforms that don't support `%s`. Note that this is for `"%s"` exactly. We don't handle the more general case of `%s` appearing in a longer format string.

## Version 1.10.0

**Features**

- Optionally disable automatic suppression of whitespace only blocks with the `Environment` class attribute `render_whitespace_only_blocks`. ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/guides/whitespace-suppression)).
- All built-in and included "extra" tags now have a `node_class` class attribute specifying the `Node` type the tag contributes to a templates AST. This is done for easier customization through `Tag` and `Node` subclassing.

## Version 1.9.4

**Fixes**

- Fixed async loading of templates with the `{% extends %}` tag. Previously templates were being loaded synchronously, even when using `render_async()`. See [#124](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/124).
- Fixed handling of recursive `{% extends %}` tags during async static analysis. See [#125](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/125).

## Version 1.9.3

**Fixes**

- Removed `is_up_to_date` from `liquid.BoundTemplate.__repr__`. It was causing `RuntimeWarning`s with Python 3.11 when using an async template loader. Specifically warnings about coroutines that were never awaited.
- Fixed the `map` filter. If given a nested array-like input, it now flattens it automatically. See [#119](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/119).
- Fixed the behavior of the `liquid` tag when other liquid tags appear within it. See [#123](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/123).

**Features**

- Added the `sum` filter, which will return the sum of all numeric values in its input sequence. ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/language/filters#sum), [source](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/blob/14ab1117705db04597d81b613ed6c4a92db10f37/liquid/builtin/filters/array.py#L222)).
- Added `Environment.setup_tags_and_filters()` for easier tag and filter registration when subclassing `Environment`. See [#122](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/122).

## Version 1.9.2

**Fixes**

- Fixed a bug where a class-based filter defining `filter_async` and setting `with_context` or `with_environment` to `True` would not be awaited. See [#117](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/117).

**Build**

- Fixed some package build issues since moving to [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/). Both version 1.9.0 and 1.9.1 inadvertently included `.mypy_cache` folders, making the distribution files significantly larger.

## Version 1.9.1

**Fixes**

- Force the "wheel" build target to include `py.typed`.
- Restore `liquid.__version__`.

## Version 1.9.0

**Fixes**

- Changed `FileSystemLoader` so that loaded templates can be pickled. See [#107](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/107).
- Fixed the `liquid.Environment` template cache. Now, when given a `cache_size` of `0`, the cache is disabled. See [#108](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/108).

**Features**

- Added context-aware template loader bootstrapping methods. See [#109](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/pull/109).
- Added support for async class-based filters. See [#115](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/pull/115).
- Added `CachingFileSystemLoader`, a template loader that handles its own cache rather than relying on the `Environment` template cache, which can't handle context-aware loaders. See [#116](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/pull/116).

## Version 1.8.1

**Fixes**

- Removed unnecessary wrapping of inline conditional expressions in `BooleanExpression`.
- Fixed async evaluation of macro arguments. Previously they were always being evaluated synchronously.
- Allow `macro` names to be quoted or unquoted. Quoted and unquoted macro names are now equivalent when defining and/or calling a macro.

**Compatibility**

- Support bracketed variables without a leading identifier. See [Shopify/liquid #1680](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/pull/1680).
- Allow whitespace control from `raw` tags. See [Shopify/liquid #1683](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/pull/1683).

## Version 1.8.0

**Features**

- Added `{% extends %}` and `{% block %}` tags for template inheritance. These are extra tags that need to be registered with a `liquid.Environment` explicitly. ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/extra/tags#extends--block), [source](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/blob/main/liquid/extra/tags/extends.py))
- Added a new `sort_numeric` filter. `sort_numeric` returns a new list with items from the input sequence sorted by any integers and/or floats found in the string representation of each item. ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/extra/filters#sort_numeric), [source](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/blob/main/liquid/extra/filters/array.py#L35))

**Fixes**

- Fixed a bug with the `cycle` tag when using `liquid.future.Environment`. We were misinterpreting unquoted cycle group names as strings rather than variables to be resolved, and not Liquid stringifying some cycled items before output. We've also rolled back changes to `CycleNode.children()` from version 1.7.0.
- Fixed a regression bug that lead to some erroneous filtered expressions tokens to be silently ignored. Specifically any tokens that appear after a valid left value and the first filter or end of expression. We now raise a `LiquidSyntaxError` in such cases. See [#103](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/103).
- Fixed parenthesized conditional expression syntax error reporting. We now raise a `LiquidSyntaxError` when given unbalanced parentheses. See [#101](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/101).

**Compatibility**

- The `{% for %}` tag now accepts a string literal as its iterable. Unlike Shopify/liquid, whether a string literal or a variable resolving to a string, the default `Environment` will iterate over characters in the string. `liquid.future.Environment` is now consistent with Shopify/liquid, in that it iterates over an "array" where the first an only item is the string. See [#102](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/102).
- The `round` filter is now consistent with Shopify/liquid and Ruby 3 when given non-integer arguments. See [Shopify/liquid#1590](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/issues/1590).

## Version 1.7.0

**Fixes**

- Fixed counting of "local" variables (those created with `assign`, `capture`, etc.) in templates rendered with the `{% render %}` tag during contextual analysis. Previously these variables were not reported in the results of `BoundTemplate.analyze_with_context()`. See [#92](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/92).
- Both [#43](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/43) and [#90](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/90) have been fixed with the introduction of `liquid.future.Environment`, an environment that aims for maximum compatibility with Ruby Liquid, without concern for backwards incompatible changes to template rendering behavior. `liquid.Environment` should be considered the most stable "standard" configuration, `liquid.future.Environment` sacrifices stability for improved compatibility with Ruby Liquid. See the [known issues page](https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/known_issues).
- Fixed a bug with AST traversal of `cycle` nodes. Previously, `CycleNode.children()` erroneously included a `cycle group name` expression, if available.

**Features**

- Report template filter usage as well as variable usage with `BoundTemplate.analyze()` and `BoundTemplate.analyze_with_context()`. See [#91](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/pull/91) and [docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/guides/static-template-analysis#filters).
- Report template tag usage when statically analyzing a template with `BoundTemplate.analyze()`. See [#97](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/pull/97) and [docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/guides/static-template-analysis#tags).
- Analyze template tags using `Environment.analyze_tags()`. This form of tag analysis happens before a template is fully parsed, giving us the opportunity to find unknown, unexpected and unbalanced tags that might cause the parser to raise an exception or skip template blocks. See [#98](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/pull/98) and [docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/guides/tag-analysis).

## Version 1.6.1

**Fixes**

- Fixed static template analysis fails with `{% break %}` and `{% continue %}`. See [#89](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/89).

## Version 1.6.0

**Fixes**

- Fixed the string representation of `liquid.expression.Identifier`, which is exposed in the results of `liquid.BoundTemplate.analyze()`. We now represent variable path elements containing a `.` as quoted strings inside square brackets. See [#87](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/87).

**Features**

- The dictionaries returned by `liquid.BoundTemplate.analyze()` now use instances of `ReferencedVariable` for their keys. `ReferencedVariable` is a `str` subclass that adds a `parts` property, being a tuple representation of the variable. See [#87](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/87).

## Version 1.5.1

**Fixes**

- Fixed `case` and `when` tag expression parsing. `when` expressions no longer fail when presented with a string containing a comma. Handling of comma and `or` separated "sub-expressions" is now consistent with the reference implementation. See [#86](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/86).

## Version 1.5.0

**Features**

The following non-standard tags and filters are reimplementations of those found in the
[Python Liquid Extra project](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid-extra), which is now
receiving bugfix updates only. Unlike standard tags and filters, which are registered
for you automatically, extra tags and filters must be explicitly registered with an
Environment`. See https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/extra/introduction.

- Added an `if` tag that supports a logical `not` operator and grouping terms with parentheses. ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/extra/tags#if-not), [source](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/blob/main/liquid/extra/tags/if_not.py))

- Added drop-in replacements for the standard output statement, `assign` tag and `echo` tag that support inline conditional expressions. ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/extra/tags#inline-if--else), [source](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/blob/main/liquid/extra/tags/if_expressions.py))

- Added `macro` and `call` tags that define parameterized Liquid snippets for reuse. ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/extra/tags#macro--call), [source](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/blob/main/liquid/extra/tags/macro.py))

- Added the `with` tag that extends the local namespace with block scoped variables. ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/extra/tags#with), [source](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/blob/main/liquid/extra/tags/_with.py))

- Added the `json`, `index`, `script_tag` and `stylesheet_tag` filters. ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/extra/filters), [source](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/tree/main/liquid/extra/filters))

**Compatibility**

- `for` tag arguments can now be separated by commas as well as whitespace. See [Shopify/liquid#1658](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/pull/1658)

## Version 1.4.7

**Hot fix**

- Fixed a bug where use of a [local namespace limit](https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/guides/resource-limits#local-namespace-limit) would raise a `TypeError` when unhashable types were found in a render context's local namespace. See [#79](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/79).

## Version 1.4.6

**Fixes**

- The `tablerowloop` drop now exposes its `row` property. See [#77](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/77).
- `for` and `tablerow` tag arguments can now be string representations of integers as well as integer literals and variables that resolve to integers. See [#78](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/78).

**Compatibility**

- The `truncatewords` filter no longer raises a `FilterArgumentError` if its argument is greater than `2147483648` and the number of words in the input string is less than the target number of words. This is inline with recent changes committed to the reference implementation of Liquid.
- The `slice` filter now clamps its arguments to between `-9223372036854775808` and `9223372036854775807`, as does the reference implementation of Liquid.

## Version 1.4.5

**Hot fix**

- Fixed a bug where boolean expressions and the default filter would treat `0.0` and `decimal.Decimal("0")` as `False`. Python considers these values to be falsy, Liquid does not. See [#74](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/74).
- Future-proof str to int conversion limit. We will now use `sys.get_int_max_str_digits` if it is available and `LIQUIDINTMAXSTRDIGITS` is not set. Note that `sys.get_int_max_str_digits` is called once at startup, so Liquid's limit will change with `sys.set_int_max_str_digits`.

## Version 1.4.4

**Fixes**

- Keep comment text for later static analysis when parsing `{% comment %}` block tags. See [#70](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/70).
- Guard against DoS by very large str to int conversion. See https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95778. ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/guides/resource-limits#string-to-integer-limit))

## Version 1.4.3

**Fixes**

- Updated the built-in `date` filter to support parsing UNIX timestamps from integers and string representations of integers. For consistency with the reference implementation of Liquid, `date` now returns the input string unchanged if it can not be parsed. See [#67](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/67).
- Fixed an issue with the "loop iteration" resource limit. It was failing to carry an existing loop counter more than one level deep when using `Context.copy()`. See [#68](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/68).

## Version 1.4.2

**Fixes**

- Fixed a potential memory leak from using `functools.lru_cache` on a class method. See [#63](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/63).
- Fixed a bug with the `default` filter. Liquid zero should not be equal to `False`. The `default` filter now returns `0` if its left value is zero. Before it would have return its default value. See [#62](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/62).
- Fixed a bug where boolean expressions would consider Liquid `0` and `false` to be equal and `0` to be falsy. Python Liquid is now consistent with the reference implementation when comparing integers to booleans. See [#65](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/65).

## Version 1.4.1

**Hot fix**

- Fixed a bug with the `StrictDefaultFilter`. It was failing to be strict when accessed by some filter decorators and helpers. Now the `default` filter will immediately return its default value if its left value defines a `force_liquid_default` property and that property is truthy. See [#62](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/62).

## Version 1.4.0

**Features**

- `StrictDefaultUndefined`, an undefined type that plays nicely with the `default` filter, is now built in. ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/guides/undefined-variables#the-default-filter))
- Configure resource limits with class attributes set on a Liquid `Environment`. Those class attributes are `context_depth_limit`, `loop_iteration_limit`, `local_namespace_limit` and `output_stream_limit`. ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/guides/resource-limits))

**Fixes**

- Fixed a bug in `StrictUndefined` that, when extended, stopped if from looking at its own `msg` property. See [#57](https://github.com/jg-rp/liquid/issues/57).

## Version 1.3.0

**Features**

- Allow render context customization by subclassing `Context` and `BoundTemplate`.
- Contextual template analysis with `BoundTemplate.analyze_with_context()`. Complementing static template analysis, released in version 1.2.0, contextual template analysis performs a template `render`, capturing information about template variable usage as it goes. ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/guides/contextual-template-analysis))

## Version 1.2.1

- Add `typing-extensions` dependency.

## Version 1.2.0

**Features**

- New inline comment tag `{% # .. %}`. See [Shopify Liquid PR #1498](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/pull/1498)
- Template static analysis. `BoundTemplate.analyze()` and `BoundTemplate.analyze_async()` traverse a template's abstract syntax tree and report template variable usage. Static tree traversal (without rendering or evaluating expressions) is supported by the new, optional `children()` methods of `liquid.expression.Expression` and `liquid.ast.Node`. ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/guides/static-template-analysis))

**Fixes**

- Fixed a bug where the lexer would incorrectly calculate an expression's line number if there were one or more newlines between a tag name and it's expression. Most notable with `liquid` tags where it is common to put a newline immediately after "liquid".
- More robust syntax error handling when parsing Liquid expression filters. The refactored expression lexers from version 1.1.3 failed to account for some classes of syntax error.

## Version 1.1.7

- Fixed a bug where double pipe characters (`||`) in a filtered expression would cause an `IndexError`. A `LiquidSyntaxError` is now raised in such cases, including the line number of the offending error.
- Changed `Environment.fromString` to catch unexpected parsing errors. A Liquid `Error` will now be raised with a message of "unexpected liquid parsing error" and its `__cause__` set to the offending exception.

## Version 1.1.6

- Fixed a bug where the `where` filter would incorrectly ignore an explicit `false` given as the target value. See #51.

## Version 1.1.5

- Prioritise object properties and keys named `size`, `first` and `last` over the special built-in properties of the same names. See #46.
- Fixed a bug with the `uniq` filter. It no longer raises an exception when given a key argument and a sequence containing objects that don't have that key/property. See #47.
- The `strip_html` filter now removes `style` and `script` tag blocks in their entirety, including everything in between. See #45.
- Added `remove_last` and `replace_last` filters.

## Version 1.1.4

- Lazy `forloop` helper variables. Don't calculate `index`, `rindex` etc. unless accessed.
- Implemented `forloop.name`, as per the reference implementation. `forloop.name` is the concatenation of the loop variable identifier and the target iterable identifier, or a string representation of a range literal, separated by a hyphen.
- Fixed a bug with the `divided_by` filter. Given a float value and integer argument, it was incorrectly doing integer division.
- Simplified `tablerowloop` and `tablerow` HTML generation.

## Version 1.1.3

- Refactored expression lexers. New, subtly different, tag expression tokenizers are now in `liquid.expressions`. Built-in tags use these lexers indirectly via new specialized expression parsers. Older expression lexers and parsers will be maintained until at least Python Liquid version 2.0 for those that use them in custom tags. See #42.
- Specialized expression parsers. Each of the three built-in expression types now have a dedicated parser defined in `liquid.expressions`, whereas before all expression parsing went through `liquid.parse.ExpressionParser.parse_expression()`. Built-in tags now use these new parsers. The more general parser will be maintained until at least Python Liquid Version 2.0. See #42.
- `liquid.parse.Parser.parse_block()` now accepts any container as its `end` argument. Benchmarks show that using a `frozenset` for `end` instead of a tuple gives a small performance improvement.
- Fixed an incompatibility with the reference implementation where Python Liquid would not recognize identifiers with a trailing question mark. This seems to be a common idiom in Ruby to indicate something returns a Boolean value.
- Added `get_source_with_context()` and `get_source_with_context_async()` to `liquid.loaders.BaseLoader`. Custom loaders can now use the active render context to dynamically modify their search space when used from `include` or `render`, or any custom tag using `Context.get_template_with_context()`.
  `Context.get_template_with_context()` also accepts arbitrary keyword arguments that are passed along to `get_source_with_context()`. The build-in `include` and `render` tags add a `tag` argument with their tag name, so custom loaders can modify their search space depending on which tag was used.
  See the [Custom Loaders](https://jg-rp.github.io/liquid/guides/custom-loaders) documentation for examples.

## Version 1.1.2

- Fixed a bug where a for loop's limit would be incorrect when using `offset: continue` multiple times (three or more `for` tags looping over the same sequence). See #41.

## Version 1.1.1

- Fixed a bug where blocks that contain whitespace only were being suppressed when the whitespace was explicitly output. Automatic whitespace suppression now only occurs in `if`, `unlesss` and `for` blocks that don't contain an output statement or `echo` tag, even if the output itself is whitespace. See #38.
- Fixed a bug where the behavior of the special `.first` and `.last` properties did not match that of the `first` and `last` filters. Now, if given a string, `.first` and `.last` will return an undefined, and the `first` and `last` filters will return `None`. See #34.

## Version 1.1.0

- Added new comment syntax. Disabled by default, enable shorthand comments with the `template_comments` argument to `liquid.Template` or `liquid.Environment`. When `True`, anything between `{#` and `#}` will be considered a comment.
- New expression cache. Distinct from the existing template cache, optionally cache common Liquid expression types (conditions, loops and filtered expressions) to avoid lexing and parsing the same expression multiple times.
- Fixed a bug where, in some cases, `forloop.length` would be incorrect when using `offsset: continue` in a loop expression.

## Version 1.0.4

- A range literal will now use a default of `0` rather than raising a `LiquidTypeError` if either its start or stop values can't be cast to an integer.
- Gracefully handle `liquid` tags that are empty or only contain whitespace.
- Gracefully handle empty `echo` tags.

## Version 1.0.3

- Explicit re-export
- Changed `Context._tag_namespace` to `Context.tag_namespace`.

## Version 1.0.2

- Fixed manifest error.

## Version 1.0.1

- Added `py.typed`

## Version 1.0.0

Version bump. First stable release.

## Version 0.11.1

- Template loaders can now include additional template meta data using the `matter` argument of `liquid.loaders.TemplateSource`. See the example `FrontMatterFileSystemLoader` in the README. See #32.
- Implemented `ChoiceLoader`, a loader that tries to load a template from a list of loaders.
- Added a `FileExtensionLoader`, a template loader that inherits from `FileSystemLoader` and automatically appends a file extension if one is missing.
- The built-in `date` filter now accepts the special input value of "today" as well as "now".
- The built-in `truncate` filter now has a default length of 50.
- The built-in `truncatewords` filter now has a default number of words of 15.
- Fixed a bug with the `slice` filter where it would return an empty string when presented with a negative start index and length that would have exceeded the length of the sequence. See #35.
- Drops can now define safe HTML string representations using a `__html__` method.
- Removed `liquid.mode.error()` in favour of `liquid.Environment.error()`

## Version 0.11.0

The following behavioral changes are the result of feedback gained from exporting Python
Liquid's "golden" test cases, and running them against Ruby Liquid (the reference
implementation). Both Python Liquid version 0.11.0 and Ruby Liquid version 5.1.0 pass
all tests currently defined in `liquid/golden/`.

- Added support for comma separated `when` expressions. See #31.
- The built-in `join`, `concat`, `where`, `uniq` and `compact` filters now use the new `sequence_filter` decorator. `sequence_filter` coerces filter left values to array-like objects. `sequence_filter` will also flatten nested array-like objects, just like the reference implementation.
- The built-in `first`, `last` and `map` filters now operate on any array-like objects. Previously they were limited to lists and tuples. Strings still don't work.
- The built-in `uniq` and `compact` filters now accept an optional argument. If an argument is provided, it should be the name of a property and the left value should be a sequence of objects.
- The `size` filter now returns a default of `0` if its left value does not have a `__len__` method.
- The `replace` and `replace_first` filters now treat undefined arguments as an empty string.
- The `slice` filter now works on lists, tuples and ranges, as well as strings.
- Fixed a bug where the `math_filter` decorator would cast strings representations of negative integers to a float rather than an int.
- Added golden test cases for all filters.

## Version 0.10.2

- Moved and organized "render" test cases into importable "golden" test cases.
- Change `RangeLiteral` string representation to match the reference implementation.
- Add newlines to `tablerow` output. As per the reference implementation.

## Version 0.10.1

- Range literals can now be assigned, compared and passed as arguments to `include` or `render` tags. They can also be filtered as if they were an array.
- Range literals will accept a float value for start and/or stop values. If a float is given for start or stop, it will be cast to an integer.
- Fixed a bug where the token stream would return the wrong token when peeking immediately after a push.

## Version 0.10.0

- Changed named counter (`increment` and `decrement`) scoping. Unless a named counter is shadowed by an `assign` or `capture`, the counter will be in scope for all subsequent Liquid expressions.
- Changed `{% increment %}` to be a post-increment operation. `{% decrement %}` remains a pre-decrement operation.
- Added `forloop.parentloop`. Access parent `forloop` objects from nested loops.

## Version 0.9.1

- `unless` blocks can now contain `else` and `elsif` blocks.
- Added support for array item access with negative indices. Closes #27.
- Improved error messages for context lookups that resulting an `IndexError` or `KeyError`.

## Version 0.9.0

- Fixed a bug where arguments to `Template()` where not being passed to the implicit environment properly (again).
- Fixed a bug where some errors from the `sort` and `map` filters were being ignored. Those filters can now raise a `FilterError`.
- Removed depreciated class-based filters.

## Version 0.8.1

- Removed `@abstractmethod` from `liquid.loaders.BaseLoader.get_source`. Custom loaders are now free to implement either `get_source` or `get_source_async` or both. The `BaseLoader` implementation of `get_source` simply raises a `NotImplementedError`.
- `liquid.loaders.TemplateSource.uptodate` (as returned by `get_source` and `get_source_async`) can now be a coroutine function. This means async loaders can check a template's source for changes asynchronously.
- Added the `cache_size` argument to `Environment` and `Template` for controlling the capacity of the default template cache.
- Easier subclassing of `liquid.parser.ExpressionParser` with `END_EXPRESSION`.

## Version 0.8.0

Version bump. Last release before removing depreciated class-based filters.

## Version 0.7.8

- The `default` filter now uses `__liquid__`, if available, when testing an object for truthy-ness.

## Version 0.7.7

- Recursive use of the "render" tag now raises a `ContextDepthError` if `MAX_CONTEXT_DEPTH` is exceeded. This is now consistent with recursive "include".
- Drops (custom classes in a render context) can now mimic primitive Liquid values when used as array indexes or hash keys, or in conditional expressions (including `case`/`when` and `unless`). If defined, the result of calling a drop's `__liquid__` method will be used in those scenarios.
- Added `base64_encode`, `base64_decode`, `base64_url_safe_encode` and `base64_url_safe_decode` filters.
- Added asynchronous template loading and rendering. When `Template.render_async` is awaited, `render` and `include` tags will load templates asynchronously. Custom loaders should implement `get_source_async`.
- Added support for asynchronous drops. If a class implements `__getitem_async__`, which is assumed to be an async version of `__getitem__`, it will be awaited instead of calling `__getitem__`.

## Version 0.7.6

- Class-based filters are now depreciated in favour of decorated filter functions. Abstract filter classes (such as `liquid.builtin.filters.string.StringFilter`) will be removed in Liquid 0.9.
- All built-in filters are now implemented as decorated functions. Legacy, class-based filters are no longer registered automatically and will be removed in Liquid 0.9.
- Legacy filter "helpers" are now depreciated and will be removed in Liquid 0.9. Use the new decorators, like `liquid.filter.string_filter` and `liquid.filter.with_context`, instead.
- The `block` argument to the `liquid.ast.ConditionalBlockNode` constructor is no longer optional.

## Version 0.7.5

- Auto reload. Disable automatic reloading of templates by passing `auto_reload=False` to `Environment` or `Template`. For deployments where template sources don't change between service reloads, setting auto_reload to `False` can yield an increase in performance by avoiding calls to `uptodate`.
- Fixed a bug where, when using the `Template` API, `undefined`, `strict_filters`, and `autoescape` where not always passed through to the implicit environment correctly.
- Added support for continuing a for loop using `offset: continue`. See #14.

## Version 0.7.4

.. \_MarkupSafe: https://github.com/pallets/markupsafe

- HTML auto-escaping. If `MarkupSafe`\_ is installed and the `autoescape` argument to `Environment` or `Template` is `True`, context variables will be HTML escaped automatically.
- `LiquidSyntaxError` exceptions now include the offending template source in the `source` property.

## Version 0.7.3

- The built-in `FileSystemLoader` now accepts a list of paths to search, in order, returning the first template source found. The `search_path` argument can be a string or path-like, or an iterable of strings or path-like objects.
- Added the `encoding` argument to `FileSystemLoader`. Files will be opened with the given encoding. Defaults to `"utf-8"`.
- `FileSystemLoader` will raise a `TemplateNotFound` exception if `..` appears in a template name.

## Version 0.7.2

- Undefined variables are now represented by the `Undefined` type, or a subclass of `Undefined`. `Undefined` behaves like `nil`, but can also be iterated over and indexed without error.
- Attempting to loop over an undefined variable no longer raises a `LiquidTypeError`.
- Optionally pass `liquid.StrictUndefined` as the `undefined` argument to `Template()` or `Environment()` to render in `strict variables` mode. All operations on an instance of `StrictUndefined` raise an `UndefinedError`.
- Filters can now raise `FilterValueError` in addition to `FilterArgumentError`. Where a `FilterValueError` refers to an issue with the left value a filter is applied to.
- Applying a built-in filter to an undefined variable no longer raises a `FilterArgumentError` in most cases.
- Added the `strict_filters` argument to the `Environment` and `Template` constructors. When `True`, the default, undefined filters raise a `NoSuchFilterFunc` exception at render time. When `False`, undefined filters are silently ignored.
- The `join` filter now forces items in its left value to strings before joining them.
- The `join` filter's argument is now optional, defaulting to a string containing a single space.

## Version 0.7.0

- New `Template` API. Create templates from strings without an `Environment`.
- The `template` object is no longer included in every render context automatically.

## Version 0.6.4

- Implemented the `blank` keyword. Empty string and strings containing only whitespace are equal to `blank`.
- Implemented the `null` keyword. `null` is an alias for `nil`.
- Implemented the `ifchanged` tag.

## Version 0.6.2

- Refactored the standard expression parser. It's now possible to extend `ExpressionParser` for use with custom tags.
- Decoupled boolean expression parsing for easier `if`, `unless` and `case` tag subclassing.

## Version 0.6.1

- Added support for Python 3.7 and PyPy3.7.

## Version 0.6.0

- Added support for named filter parameters.
- The `default` filter now accepts the named parameter `allow_false`.
- The `truncate_words` filter now forces a minimum number of words to 1.
- The `newline_to_br` filter now replaces `\n` and `\r\n` with `<br />\n`.
- The `strip_newlines` filter strips `\r\n`.
