# liquid.future.Environment

**_New in version 1.7.0_**

An [`Environment`](./environment.md) configured for maximum compatibility with the reference implementation of Liquid. See [known issues](/introduction/known-issues) for a description of the incompatibilities that `liquid.future.Environment` resolves.

`liquid.Environment` should be considered the most stable "standard" configuration, `liquid.future.Environment` sacrifices stability for improved compatibility with Ruby Liquid.

## `Environment`

`class Environment([options])`

See [`liquid.Environment`](./environment.md)
